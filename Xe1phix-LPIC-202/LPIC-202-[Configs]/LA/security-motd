Because of the nature of the lab the setup is slightly different from 
our other environments. 

You'll connect to the provided server and then use 
"lxc exec <servername> -- bash" to get a root shell on the selected server.
I recommend three separate connections to the container host so you can 
access all three servers individually.

**** NOTE THAT THE CONTAINERS MAY TAKE A MINUTE TO START UP. ****

You can use "lxc list" and check that all containers are RUNNING and have
IP Addresses listed (the router requires 2 IP addresses).
